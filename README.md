# imageclassificationDL
Simplified way of building an image classifier using TensorFlow/Keras.

The project involves creating a simple image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras in a Jupyter Notebook:

Environment Setup:

Install TensorFlow, Keras, and other necessary libraries.
Import Libraries:

Import TensorFlow, Keras, and any other required libraries.
Dataset Preparation:

Load a dataset (e.g., MNIST) for image classification.
Preprocess the dataset by normalizing pixel values and splitting into training and test sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (Optional):

Visualize a few images from the dataset to understand the data.
Model Building:

Create a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras layers.
Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
Training the Model:

Train the model using the training dataset.
Monitor and track the training process for multiple epochs.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset to measure accuracy and loss.
Experimentation:

Experiment with different architectures (e.g., adding layers, changing neurons), datasets (e.g., Fashion-MNIST), and hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate).
Visualize training/validation curves, confusion matrices, or custom metrics to observe the effects of changes on model performance.
Training for More Epochs:

Optionally, train the model for more epochs to further improve performance, while monitoring for signs of overfitting.
Observation and Analysis:

Analyze the effects of changes made to the model and parameters on its performance metrics.
Adjust the model architecture or parameters based on observations to enhance model performance.
The project provides an introductory hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating a basic image classification model using deep learning techniques, allowing for experimentation and learning by observing the effects of various modifications on the model's performance.
